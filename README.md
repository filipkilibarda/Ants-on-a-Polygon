Ants on a Polygon...
----
So you have `n` ants arranged on a symetrical polygon with `n` sides. Each ant moves toward the ant infront of it. We can assume that each ant starts a distance, `1` from the ant infront of it and moves at a speed `1`.

Question
----
How long does it take for them to reach the center?

Solution
----
Thanks to [Jake Vanderplas' animation tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/), I was able to make a cool animation out of this problem.

So start off with just 4 ants, because that's the simplest case, and you'll see why.
